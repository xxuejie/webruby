# Introduction

This project brings mruby to the browser. It uses [emscripten]
(https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) to compile the mruby source code into
JavaScript and runs in the browser.

Please refer to this [tutorial](http://qiezi.me/2013/01/09/webruby-1-2-3-tutorial/) for how to use webruby.

# Notes

Currently this is still a toy project. Though several demos have been created, it hasn't been used in a production environment. Feel free to play with this, but please give it a complete evaluation before using it in your real-world project.

**For Mac users**: The latest version of emscripten uses `python2` as the default python interpreter. If you are using a Mac and rely on the default python. Please add a link from `python` to `python2` before building:

    $ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/python2
